## Inspiration
Finances are a great contributor to our well- being, and we all want to be independent of all financial constraints. Therefore we thought of developing an application which will allow us to track and control our expenses so that we won't fall  hostage to the consequences of our financial impulses.

## What it does
This application allows the user to :
- Track monthly expenses and incomes
- Make predictions about future expenses and income
- Allow the user to set goals for himself
- Visualize the statistic of monthly, weekly and yearly financial transactions 
- Recognize and analyse financial patterns of the user 
- Suggest a set of weakly or monthly challenges accordingly to help them develop good habits
- Gamify the process for entertainment and motivation

## How we built it
- Use deep learning techniques to train our model on income, expenses and the other activities and data of the users.
- For the challenge prediction we use modern Data Mining techniques to detect negative patters and then classify them and match them into specific categories of challenges.

## Challenges we ran into
- Provide the user with a better user experience compared to the existing apps
- Our model requires enormous amount of data,  time and resources.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Good user experience and graphical interface
- Innovative aspect of  AI empowered and personalized human assistance
- Team work and good time management 
-  Powerful AI application used in the context of finances

## What we learned
-  Team work and good time management 
- New AI and machine learning techniques
- Design thinking and usage of new tools 

## What's next for Mesroufi
- improve the model  by fine-tuning it
- Integrate banks to automate and facilitate the tracking of transactions
